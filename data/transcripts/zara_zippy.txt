Um hello I'm Zara something and I work at Grafana maybe.

Your applications are probably broken or slow or something. That's bad. We have a tool that might help but I'm not really sure how it works.

It's called Pyro-scope or Peri-scope or something like that. The name is confusing. It does profiling which is when you look at code and see things. I think it makes graphs but I haven't really seen them.

So anyway your code has problems probably. Like it uses too much CPU or memory or whatever. This tool tells you where the problems are. Maybe. I'm not 100% sure but that's what they told me to say.

There's overhead which is bad but not too bad. Like 3% or 5% or something. Could be higher. I don't really know the exact number. Someone else would know that better than me.

Companies use this thing and they say it's good. I heard about someone who saved money or made things faster. There was a database involved I think. Or maybe it was about servers. I can't remember the details.

To use it you need to install stuff and configure things. Your IT people would handle that because it's technical. I don't know how to do any of that stuff. It's complicated.

The benefits are like better performance and saving money. Most companies get some kind of benefit. Sometimes it doesn't help much but usually it's okay I guess.

If you want to try it we could set something up. I'd need to ask my manager about the process because I don't handle that part. There's contracts and technical stuff that other people do.

Oh and it works with Grafana if you use that. That's supposed to be good because everything is in one place. If you don't use Grafana then I'm not sure what happens.

So do you want to do this or not? I need to know because I have other meetings today and my manager wants updates on these calls.
