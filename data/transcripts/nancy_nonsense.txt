Hi um I'm Nancy and I think I'm supposed to tell you about something called profiling or something.

So like your computers probably don't work very good sometimes. That's normal I guess. Everyone has problems with computers. They're complicated and stuff.

We have this thing that maybe helps. I think it's called Pyroscope but maybe it's Periscope. The names are confusing. It does something with your code. Like it looks at it and tells you things. I'm not really sure what things though.

There are these graph thingies that are supposed to help. They have lots of colors which is nice I guess. Your computer people probably know how to read them. I don't really understand them myself. They look complicated.

The thing runs on your computers and uses some of your computer power. Maybe 5% or 10%. Could be more. I'm not really good with numbers. But it's supposed to not break anything.

Some companies have used this I think. One time someone told me about a company that had slow computers and then they used this thing and the computers got faster. That's good right? Faster computers are better than slow computers.

Your tech people would need to install it somehow. I don't know how that works because I'm not technical. There's probably instructions somewhere. Or maybe someone could help you with that.

The benefits are that your applications work better. At least that's what I think happens. Sometimes it saves money too. Companies like saving money so that's probably good.

If you want to try this we could probably make that happen. I'd need to ask someone else about how to do it though. There's paperwork and technical stuff that I don't handle. Other people know about that stuff.

So do you want to do this thing or not? I have other meetings and I need to know what to tell my boss. He asked me to find out if you're interested.
