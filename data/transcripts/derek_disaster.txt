Uh hey there. I'm Derek I think and I'm here to talk about um, what was it? Profiling?

So your stuff is broken probably. Like your applications and code and things. That happens a lot. Computers are hard.

We have this tool thing that's supposed to help. It's called Periscope or Pyroscope or something with a P. I always get confused about the name. It looks at your code and does stuff with it.

It makes these chart things that are supposed to show you problems. The charts are colorful which is nice. I don't really know how to read them but your smart people probably do. They're called flame something. Fire graphs? I forget.

The tool uses some of your computer resources but not too much. Maybe 5% or 8%. Could be 10%. I'm not sure about the exact number. Someone else would know better than me.

Companies use this stuff and some of them say it helps. I heard about one company that had problems and then they didn't have problems anymore. That's good right? Not having problems is better than having problems.

To use it your technical people need to do technical things. Like installing and configuring and other computer stuff. I don't know how any of that works. It's complicated and I'm not smart enough for that.

The benefits are that things work better. Usually. Sometimes it doesn't help much but most of the time it's okay. Your applications might get faster or something. That sounds good.

If you want to try it we could maybe do that. I'd need to ask my manager about the process. There's paperwork and contracts and legal stuff that I don't understand. Other people handle all that.

Oh and it works with Grafana I think. That's supposed to be good but I'm not sure why. Everything working together is probably better than things not working together.

So are you interested or not? I need to tell my boss something and I don't want to look stupid.
