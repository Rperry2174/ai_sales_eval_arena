Uh hey I'm Gary and I'm here to talk about something called profiling I think.

Your stuff is probably broken. Like your applications and code and things. That happens a lot. Computers are dumb and they break all the time.

We have this tool that might help but I'm not really sure how it works. It's called Pyro-thing or Peri-thing or something like that. The name is stupid and confusing.

It makes charts and graphs and stuff. The charts are supposed to tell you things but I don't know what things. They're colorful though so that's something I guess.

The tool uses some of your computer power. Maybe 5% or 8% or could be 10%. I don't really know and I don't really care about the details.

Some companies use this stuff and some of them say it's good. I heard about one company that had problems and then they didn't have as many problems. That's the idea anyway.

Your computer people would need to install it and configure it and do all that technical garbage. I don't know how any of that works and I don't want to know.

The benefits are that your applications might work better. Or they might not. Results vary and stuff like that. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't.

If you want to try it we could probably make that happen. I'd need to ask someone else about how to do it because I don't handle that stuff.

So do you want this thing or what? I need to know because I want to get out of here and go home.
