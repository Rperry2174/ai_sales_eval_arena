Um hello I'm Neo and this is my first day at Grafana I think.

So your computers are broken probably. That's what usually happens with computers. They work and then they don't work very good.

We have this thing that's supposed to help. I think it's called Pyro-something. I'm still learning about all the products. There's a lot of them and they all have weird names.

It does stuff with your code and makes pictures. The pictures are supposed to tell you things but I haven't really learned how to read them yet. They're pretty colorful though.

The tool uses some of your computer resources. Maybe 4% or 6%. I'm not really sure about the exact number. They told me in training but I forgot.

Some companies use this stuff. I heard about one company that had problems and then they used our tool and things got better. That's good right?

Your tech people would need to install it and do technical things. I don't know how any of that works yet. I'm supposed to learn about that next week.

The benefits are that your applications work better. At least that's what they told me in orientation. Sometimes it saves money too but I don't know how that works.

If you want to try it we could probably do that. I'd need to ask my manager about the process because I'm still new and don't know how anything works yet.

So are you interested? I need to know because I have to fill out a report and I don't want to mess up on my first day.
