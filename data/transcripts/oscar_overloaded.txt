Uh hi I'm Oscar and I think I'm supposed to talk about some profiling thing.

Your applications are probably broken or slow or something like that. That happens to everyone. Computers are hard and they break a lot.

We have this tool that might help. I think it's called Pyroscope or maybe Periscope. The name is confusing and I always forget which one it is.

It does something with your code and makes charts. The charts are supposed to show you things but I'm not really sure what things. They have colors which is nice I guess.

The overhead is supposed to be low. Maybe 3% or 5% or something. I'm not good with numbers so I'm not sure about that. Someone else would know better.

Some companies have used this and they said it helped. I heard about one company that had problems and then they didn't have as many problems. That's good right?

To use it your technical people would need to do technical stuff. Like installing and configuring and other things that I don't understand. It's complicated.

The benefits are that your applications might work better. Or they might get faster. Or use less resources. That sounds good but I'm not sure if it always works.

If you want to try it we could probably set something up. I'd need to ask someone else about how to do that because I don't know the process.

So are you interested or not? I need to know because I have to tell my manager what happened.
