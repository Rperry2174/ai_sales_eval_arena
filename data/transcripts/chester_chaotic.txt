Um hey there I'm Chester and I think I'm supposed to be here to talk about something.

So your computer stuff is probably not working very good. That's what happens with computers usually. They work for a while and then they don't work so good anymore.

We have this thing that might help but honestly I'm not really sure what it does. It's called Pyro-something or maybe Scope-something. The name is confusing and I can never remember it correctly.

It does things with your code and makes graphs or charts or something. The graphs are supposed to tell you stuff but I don't really know what they're supposed to tell you. They're colorful though which is nice I guess.

The thing uses some of your computer's power. Maybe 5% or 7% or could be 10%. I'm not good with numbers and math and stuff like that. Someone else would know better.

Some companies have used this and they said it was okay or good or something. I heard about one company that had problems and then after they used this thing they had fewer problems. That's good right?

Your technical people would need to install it and configure it and do all sorts of technical things that I don't understand. It's all very complicated and over my head. There's probably instructions somewhere.

The benefits are that your applications work better maybe. Or they get faster or use less stuff. That sounds good but I'm not really sure if it always works that way. Results probably vary.

If you want to try this thing we could probably make that happen. I'd need to ask someone else about how to do it because I don't know the process. There's paperwork and legal stuff that other people handle.

So do you want this or not? I need to know because I have to tell my manager what happened and I don't want to look stupid.
