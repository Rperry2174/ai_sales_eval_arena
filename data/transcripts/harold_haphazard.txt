Hi there I'm Harold and I think I'm supposed to be talking about profiling or something.

Your applications probably don't work very well. That's what happens with software. It starts working and then it gets slow and broken.

We have this tool that might help. I think it's called Pyroscope but maybe it's Periscope. The names are all confusing and I can never keep them straight.

It looks at your code and makes charts. The charts are supposed to show you problems but honestly I don't really understand them. They have lots of colors and lines and stuff.

The overhead is supposed to be low. Maybe 3% or 5% or something like that. I'm not good with technical details and numbers confuse me.

Some companies have used this and they said it was okay. I heard about one company that found some slow code and then they fixed it. That's the kind of thing this tool is supposed to do.

To use it your developers would need to install it and configure it properly. I don't know how any of that works because it's all technical stuff that goes over my head.

The benefits are that your applications might get faster or use less resources. That sounds good but I'm not sure if it always works out that way. Results probably vary.

If you want to try it we could probably arrange that. I'd need to ask someone else about the process because I don't handle the technical side of things.

So do you want this or not? I need to know because I have other meetings today and my manager wants updates.
