Um hi I'm Wanda maybe and I think I work at Grafana or something.

So like your computer things are probably not working good. That's bad I guess. Computers are confusing and they break a lot.

We have some kind of tool that might help but I'm not really sure what it does. It's called Pyro-something or maybe Peri-something. The name is weird and I can never remember it right.

It does stuff with your code. Like it looks at it and makes pictures or graphs or something. The pictures are supposed to tell you things but I don't know what things. They're colorful though which is nice.

The tool runs on your computers and uses some power. Maybe 5% or maybe 10%. Could be more. I'm not good with numbers and percentages and stuff like that. Someone smarter would know.

Some companies used this thing and they said it was okay. I heard about one company that had slow stuff and then it got faster. That's good right? Fast is better than slow usually.

Your computer people would need to install it or configure it or do technical things. I don't know how any of that works. It's too complicated for me. There's probably manuals or help files or something.

The benefits are that your applications work better maybe. Sometimes they get faster or use less resources. That sounds good but I'm not sure if it always works. Results probably vary or whatever.

If you want to try it we could probably arrange that. I'd need to ask someone else about the process because I don't handle the technical stuff. There's forms and contracts and legal things that other people do.

So do you want this thing or not? I need to know because I have other meetings and my manager wants to know what happened in this call.
